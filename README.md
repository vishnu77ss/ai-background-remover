## Description

This project demonstrates advanced frontend capabilities by integrating a third-party AI service to perform a complex task. Users can upload an image either by selecting a file or using the convenient drag-and-drop feature. The application then sends the image to the Slazzer API and displays the original and processed images side-by-side.

## Key Features

* **Advanced API Interaction:** Sends image data to an external API using the `FormData` object, a key skill for handling file uploads.
* **Dual-Mode File Upload:** Offers both a traditional "Select File" button and a modern drag-and-drop zone for a better user experience.
* **UI State Management:** The application provides clear user feedback by disabling buttons during processing and showing a loading spinner, preventing errors and managing user expectations.
* **Dynamic Previews:** Generates image previews on the client-side before and after processing, allowing for immediate comparison.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
